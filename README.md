# Non-Parametric Correlation

Nadaraya-Watson estimator for stocks correlation. Non-parametric approaches can be flexible, and valuable, when computing the correlation between stocks, which, in reality is not constant over time. The time dependance feature supposes variation, thus allowing a clear analysis of the time series's dynamic nature.
